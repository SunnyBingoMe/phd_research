# Analysis on local machine
#
# My machine has 4 physical cores and 16 GB memory. The full objects will be
# 1.3 GB each, which is a little too big for comfort. Better just read the
# first two lanes in to cut this size in half.

# There are 4 gzipped files here
station_files = list.files("~/data/pems/", full.names = TRUE)

# Takes 47 seconds to read a single gzipped file.
system.time({

# Simple questions:
# 1) Is one lane faster than the the other?
# 2) Does one lane have more traffic than the other?
#
# To answer:
# 1) Only look at rows that don't contain NA's
# 2) Compare the means of the last 6 columns

s2 <- station[complete.cases(station), -c(1, 2)]

# About 6.4 million

# A little more formally:
t.test(s2$speed2 - s2$speed1)

# Suppose the traffic is between 50 and 90 mph. Then is one lane faster than the
# other?
in50_90 <- with(s2, 50 <= speed1 & speed1 <= 90 & 50 <= speed2 & speed2 <= 90)

s <- s2[in50_90, ]

# Down to 2.1 million
dim(s)

median(s$speed1)
median(s$speed2)

# So the average speed for fast traffic is about 4.1 mph faster in the 1st
# lane.

# Leave out the long tails
d2 <- delta[abs(delta) < 17]
