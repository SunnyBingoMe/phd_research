# parallelism, and numerical precision.

# Idea: Given an observation x of length n, split it into subvectors x_i
# 1) Compute the likelihood for x_1
# 2) For x_i compute the conditional likelihood given x_i-1
#
# This means that the permutation of indices has already happened and Sigma
# reflects this.
# I think Guinness's approach is more sophisticated than this.
