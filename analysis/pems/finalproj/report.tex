\section{Abstract}

The goal of this project is to search for the presence of congestion
shockwaves in the raw 2016 PeMS data.

\section{Review}

\cite{lu2007freeway} describe a numerical algorithm to detect shockwaves
based on trajectory data. Their vehicle trajectory plots appear to show
shockwaves that last for 20 to 30 seconds for a fixed location.

Given sufficiently dense velocity observations over space and time it may
be possible to recover "average" trajectories. In the case of the PeMS data
we have the mean velocity for 30 second intervals. Then a shockwave lasting
20-30 seconds would manifest as a lower mean velocity for one or two
periods.

\cite{williams2003modeling} discuss using ARIMA models for univariate
traffic streams.

\quote{
The  ARIMA  ( 1,0,1 ) ( 0,1,1 ) model provides a simple three-parameter
linear recursive estima-tor. Therefore,  an  appropriately  applied
seasonal ARIMA modelshould   be   considered   the   parametric   model
benchmark   forunivariate  traffic  condition  forecasting.  
}

So we might ask the question: how different are each of these sensors in
terms of model parameters? We can fit seasonal trends and ARIMA
models to each of the stations. All the papers I looked at talk about
predicting traffic conditions.

Areas with few on ramps should be very different than areas with
