\section{Review}

\cite{chung2007relation} describe traffic characteristics at three fixed bottlenecks.

\cite{chen2004systematic} describe systematic identification of bottlenecks from 5
minute loop data. We want to do a similar thing with 30 second data on a larger scale.
Papers citing this paper also look relevant like the Oregon ones.

Another thing to do- find all the active fixed bottlenecks in the 2016 PeMS data.
One general heuristic for this is to find all places that the velocity $v$ or
density $\rho$ is much lower upstream than downstream for at least some
period of time $T_{\min}$. Then it's reasonable to say there is a
bottleneck between those two mile markers.

We can do this with a two stage approach. First look at every timestamp and
check if the average velocity for station $i$ is below some threshold
$v_{i}$ while station $i + 1$, the next one downstream on the freeway has
traffic moving at velocity greater than $v_{i + 1}$. If this condition persists for
longer than $t_{\min}$ then call it a bottleneck between station $i$ and $i
+ 1$. This can then be used to check dimensions of the bottleneck in time
and space. There we go- that's a great title- Spatial temporal dimensions
of traffic bottlenecks.
