\section{Abstract}

Goal- Find all the active fixed bottlenecks in the 2016 PeMS data. Quantify
when and where they exist. Rank them in order of severity. Distinguish
temporary from permanent bottlenecks. Compare with highway incident data to
determine which are caused by accidents. 

To do all this we'll need heuristics and well defined measures for
comparison. It would be best to take this from the established literature.

Note- These are initial thoughts before doing the literature review.

One general heuristic for this is to find all places that the velocity $v$ or
density $\rho$ is much lower upstream than downstream for at least some
period of time $T_{\min}$. Then it's reasonable to say there is a
bottleneck between those two mile markers.

We can do this with a two stage approach. First look at every timestamp and
check if the average velocity for station $i$ is below some threshold
$v_{i}$ while station $i + 1$, the next one downstream on the freeway has
traffic moving at velocity greater than $v_{i + 1}$. If this condition persists for
longer than $t_{\min}$ then call it a bottleneck between station $i$ and $i
+ 1$. This can then be used to check dimensions of the bottleneck in time
and space. There we go- that's a great title- Spatial temporal dimensions
of traffic bottlenecks.

Choosing an appropriate $v_i$ here may be difficult- so it would be best to
use something different for each station. 

We may want to forget about detecting bottlenecks if accurate data
are too far apart in space or time- ie. 5 miles is probably too far.

\section{Review}

\cite{chung2007relation} describe traffic characteristics at three fixed bottlenecks.

\cite{chen2004systematic} describe systematic identification of bottlenecks from 5
minute loop data. We want to do a similar thing with 30 second data on a larger scale.
They use velocity measurements, which are not always reliable / available. So it might be 
better in our case to use occupancy and flow.

The say: "Five-minute data provide sufficient
resolution for this analysis because the traffic features sought are on
the order of 30 min or more." So maybe we look for finer features.

\cite{hall1991freeway} use flow and occupancy since velocity is not available.

\begin{quote}
Averages of flow and occupancy across the three lanes were
used. The two tended to vary together in the period before
cu11gesliu11 aud Lu diverge duriug Lhe cuugesled period. Determining
the exact beginning and end of congestion was,
however, difficult from these numbers, so the ratio of occupancy
to flow was used. Three values of the ratio were tested
for the threshold level: 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. A ratio of 1.0 gives
a longer duration of bottleneck flows, some of which were
very low, suggesting that demand was below capacity. A ratio
of 1.2 excludes sustained periods (10 min) of high flows (5,800
vehicles/hr or more). A ratio of 1.1 or above persisting for 3
min was selected as the criterion for the identification of the
start of a queue.

\cite{wieczorek2010techniques} applies this to Oregon data.
