Just spoke with Professor Michael Zhang after class. He suggested a nice
visualization of the traffic travel time contours. This would have contour
lines for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, etc. Then I could watch how those lines
change over time. In rush hour the contours should be smaller.

Big picture- I could use the PeMS data to examine and present the long term
trends in the Bay Area, ie. for the last 10 years.

WalkScore has already made [something
similar](https://www.walkscore.com/professional/travel-time-js-api.php#widget-example)
This can be embedded in a website through a widget.

Google has an [interesting
patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US6317686) on travel time analysis.

Data__ Another paper on loop detector data from Peter Bickel.

Seems like many methods exist here:
