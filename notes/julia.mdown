Looking at how [Julia does parallelism](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.5/manual/parallel-computing/).

They use the idea of a `Future`. A master process makes a remote call and
then continues, not waiting for it to finish. I like their use of macros
for these.

Like everything in Julia, it seems that within the parallel programming
area they have many nice features, and they've learned from the mistakes
and weird things in other languages.
