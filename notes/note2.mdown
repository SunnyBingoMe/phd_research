MCMC approach to bus passengers using automatic passenger counts. Their
data sources may be interesting. The title of the journal is _Journal of
Advanced Transportation_. Could be other relevant articles there.

## Applications in Traffic Analysis

Similar technical article- same year, same authors. Provides some
distribution for arrival times.
