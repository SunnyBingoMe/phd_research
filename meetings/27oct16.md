Duncan spent a couple hours going over the state of the art of Rcodegen and
related packages. One high level goal here is to programmatically generate
R bindings to an arbitrary C or C++ library. This is useful since many R
packages simply wrap C / C++ libraries. So automatically generating R
bindings takes away much human error associated with this. It's also useful
to regenerate these bindings as the library is updated.

Since 1998 Duncan has been working on related projects: lcc (little c
compiler), SWIG, gcc -tu, clang.

## Two approaches

RCodeGen could generate R code programatically by modifying `body,
formals`, etc, or it could just process strings. Duncan oscillates between
the two, but thinks that string processing is the best first approach.

A limitation of `RCIndex` is that it doesn't do anything with the bodies of
the functions. This would be an area I could focus my research.
Does `clang` make this available? Looking at what `clang` itself can do:
http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1VarDecl.html there is a _ton_
of stuff here.

## Next steps

1. Check related projects
3. Read R extensions manual as definitive reference
2. See what capabilities `Rcpp` has. Will it make things easier?


Considering hooking into `clang` directly to interact with their data
structures. Why reimplement what the software already does well?
Looking through the [Clang
docs](http://clang.llvm.org/features.html#diverseclients) this option
appeals to me.  Looks like [Python
bindings](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/tree/master/bindings/python)
are actively maintained. This may be a very nice path for the task. See 2011
[blog
post](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/07/03/parsing-c-in-python-with-clang).
Python has various ways of automatically generating bindings like SWIG and
[SIP](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SIP). So I'd be making something similar
for R.
