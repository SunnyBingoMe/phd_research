Met with Nick to get a basic overview of the goals of R compilation and
learn where he's at in his research.

For the past year or more Nick has been mostly working on type inference
for R- call it Type Inference V1.

This needs to correctly handle `if` statements that may do things like:

```
if(x < 3){
    x = 2
} else {
    x = "hello"
}
```

Other challenges include breaking from `for` loops.

There were some difficulties with the initial approach:

- Control flow not directly represented
- S3 class system not ideal for representing data, ie. handling `return()` as if it were a normal
  function call.
- No references / functional programming style made it difficult to
  manipulate the abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Not possible to directly get parent of a node

Nick is now working on Type Inference V2 using a
[Hadley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) type system.

- Uses Winston Chang's R6 reference classes

Duncan notes- There needs to be some separation between what the type
inference does and what the compilation package does.
