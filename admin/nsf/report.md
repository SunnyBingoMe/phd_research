> Please write a 2-3 paragraph SUMMARY of your fellowship activities and

> This should be written for the public, and should address both the
> Intellectual Merit and the Broader Impact of your work.

In the fall I partnered with a fellow graduate student, Irene Kim, to
initiate and organize a student led statistics department seminar. This
broadened our collective awareness of active areas of statistics research.
It also resulted in a greater sense of community among the graduate
students. Additionally, I met with several groups of community college
students interested in transferring and joining our department.

Last summer I wrote a software package called `rddlist`
integrating R with Apache Spark through the use of distributed data
structures. This was in the context of an internship with the R Consortium
working on the ddR (distributed data in R) package. These projects are
efforts towards the broader goal of building statistical software that
scales up to larger and larger amounts of data. All development was done in
an open source environment, so anyone is free to use the code.

Throughout the year I presented several talks on parallel R programming techniques and
concepts.  This motivates and relates to my continued efforts researching
code analysis and parallel programming.  The first talk in October 2016 was
through the NSF funded Research Training Group, which drew in a broad
audience of mostly graduate students from different departments. Another
talk was for the undergraduate organized iidata data science convention in
February 2017. I went deeper into an example of GPU programming to show how
to improve code run time by orders of magnitude. Professionals as well as
undergraduate and graduate students from all across campus attended the
talk.
