In the fall I partnered with a fellow graduate student, Irene Kim, to
initiate and organize a student led statistics department seminar. This
broadened our collective awareness of active areas of statistics research.
We successfully handed off the leadership to other student organizers and
the seminar continues to be held. It also has resulted in a greater sense of
community among the graduate students. Additionally, I met with several
groups of community college students interested in transferring and joining
our department.

Last summer I wrote a software package called `rddlist`
integrating R with Apache Spark through the use of distributed data
structures. This was in the context of an internship with the R Consortium
working on the ddR (distributed data in R) package. These projects are
efforts towards the broader goal of building statistical software that
scales up to larger amounts of data. All development was done in
an open source environment, so the code is freely available for public use.
I've also continued contributing to more established open source projects
through patches and code review.

Throughout the year I presented several talks on parallel R programming
techniques and concepts. The first talk in October 2016 was through the NSF
funded Research Training Group, which drew in a broad audience of mostly
graduate students from different departments. Another talk was for the
undergraduate organized iidata data science convention in February 2017. In
June I will take my PhD Qualifying exams, so I have been reviewing academic
literature on parallel programming and conducting case studies and
experiments. I took a graduate class in transportation with the civil
engineering department which provided compelling practical use cases where
parallel statistical programming will enable novel statistical analyses on
hundreds of gigabytes of traffic sensor data.  This motivates and relates
to my continued efforts researching and building software for code analysis
and parallel programming.
